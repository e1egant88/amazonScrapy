Great product  Thank you
Nice adaptor works very well.
Good staff for your camera
Good quality product. My GoPro 8 fits nicely with no movement within the case.
Don¡¯t waste your time looking around and get this suppliers case it has a lovely soft velour inside the case is big enough in size to incorporate the lens covers or ¡­.your actual neoprene slide on cover that comes with you Insta360 X2 ¡­ that slipped on it zips up snug and works like a dream any other brand maybe bring smaller wouldn¡¯t fit it in with the neoprene cover ¡­so it was a great design case works beautifully zippers high-quality can highly recommend this product ¨C Andrew P
Good quality product but tightening lever makes noise when I attach it to my bike.
